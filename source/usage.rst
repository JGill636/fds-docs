Usage
=====

Installation
------------

To use Lumache, first install it using pip:

Calling my slope formula from a different file :eq:`slope`

Ref to euler using eq role :eq:`euler`

Does this work? :eq:`eq2`

What about this equation :eq:`eq3`

Final equation :eq:`eq4`

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install lumache

New Section
===========

Euler's identity, equation :eq:`euler`, was elected one of the most
beautiful mathematical formulas.

.. math::
   :label: euler2

   e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0

.. math::
   :label: slope2

   y = mx + b

.. math::
   :label: eq5

   (a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\&=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2


Does this work? :eq:`euler2`
